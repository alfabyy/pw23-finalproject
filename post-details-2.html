          <p>The Ministry of Health released the Health Service Facilities Preparedness Monitoring Team for the 2023 Christmas and New Year 2024 Holidays at the Indonesian Ministry of Health Ceremony Field on Thursday (12/21/2023). Secretary General of the Indonesian Ministry of Health, Kunta Wibawa Nugraha, in his speech said that the release of the monitoring team was an effort by the health sector to prepare health services in anticipation of the Christmas and New Year holidays. "The central government has collaborated with regional governments including health services, hospitals, community health centers and other health services in monitoring the Christmas and New Year holiday routes," said Secretary General Kunta. Secretary General Kunta continued that the Ministry of Health is mobilizing the central and regional governments to prepare health service posts at toll exits, operational toll lanes, non-toll roads or tourist attractions, terminals, stations, airports and ports. Availability and readiness of ambulances, preparation of community health centers, hospitals and Port Health Offices (KKP), as well as carrying out massive health promotion and dissemination of information related to the 3M movement. â€œThis health service collaborates with regional health services and community health centers and also other health services. "The direction is that later there will be rest areas, on homecoming routes, including that we will also prepare hospitals," continued Secretary General Kunta.
            Secretary General Kunta added that the monitoring team would look at readiness at KKP, train stations, public safety centers (PSC), referral hospitals, health centers, ports, places of worship, tourist attractions, bus terminals and health posts. The team that will be sent is a cross-program combination at the Ministry of Health.
            Secretary General Kunta closed his remarks with the hope that the health post monitoring team could carry out their duties as well as possible and continue to maintain health protocols.</p>

            Director General of Indonesian Health Services dr. Azhar Jaya in his speech said that there are six routes for monitoring health facilities and health posts ahead of Christmas, namely the Jakarta-Palembang, Jakarta-Surabaya, Jakarta-Yogyakarta, Surabaya-Bali-NTB, Medan-Padang, and Makassar-Tana Toraja routes. "These posts will later be filled by monitoring team friends from the regions and the Central Government will continue to monitor whether it is running or whether there are obstacles so that they can be resolved quickly during Christmas," said Director General Azhar Jaya. Director General Azhar explained that the monitoring team from the central Ministry of Health had 150 members. The monitoring team is supported by hospitals and other health service facilities with around 15,000 officers spread throughout Indonesia, including Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi and especially in tourist areas and crowds. "This preparedness monitoring team not only monitors health services, but also anticipates various incidents such as accidents that occur during homecoming and early disease detection," said Director General Azhar. Monitoring the preparedness of health service facilities ahead of the Christmas holiday will start from 18 December 2023 to 3 January 2024.
