          <p>Throughout 2023, there were many events that occurred throughout the world. Some of them are natural disasters that destroy houses, claim lives and cause other impacts. The following is a summary of a number of natural disasters in various countries in 2023, quoted from Fox News and other sources. Some of these disasters have become topics of conversation throughout the world.</p>

          <p><b>1. Earthquake in TÃ¼rkiye and Syria (February 6, 2023)</b></p>

          <p>A powerful earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale rocked Syria and Turkey in early February. A series of aftershocks followed this main earthquake, claiming the lives of around 50,000 people, mainly in Turkey. Reporting from the CNN World page, the earthquake was one of the strongest to hit the region in more than 100 years. It is known that the earthquake occurred 23 kilometers east of Nurdagi, in Turkey's Gaziantep province with a depth of 24.1 kilometers. This incident destroyed thousands of buildings and worsened conditions in areas that had been hit by civil war for 12 years in Syria.</p>

          <p><b>2. Libya Floods (12-14 September 2023)</b></p>

          <p>Heavy rainstorms caused two dams in Libya to overflow and directed floodwaters towards the eastern city of Derna. The impact was very detrimental, forcing a large number of people to be carried away into the sea.
            Several countries and human rights groups at the time offered help as rescue teams struggled to find survivors under the rubble. As stated in CNN World, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) said the country was facing an "unprecedented humanitarian crisis" after the disaster.</p>

          <p><b>3. Morocco Earthquake (September 8 ,2023)</b></p>

          <p>A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck Morocco's Atlas Mountains in early September, killing around 2,900 people. On Friday after 23.00 local time (18.00 ET), an earthquake occurred at a depth of 18.5 kilometers (11.4 miles), according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) as quoted on the CNN World page.

            The epicenter was about 72 kilometers (44.7 miles) southwest of Marrakech, a city with a population of about 840,000 that is a popular tourist destination. As a result, at least 2,012 people died and 1,404 others were in critical condition.</p>

          <p><b>4. Wildfires in Hawaii (August 11, 2023)</b></p>

          <p>In early August, forest fires swept through the Hawaiian island of Maui, burning down much of the historic town of Lahaina. This situation prompted residents to take shelter by fleeing to the sea to avoid the spread of the fire. Quoting from the CNN US page, it is estimated that 100 people died in this incident. It was reported that around 86% of the buildings affected by the fire were residential. The report also noted that around 2,170 hectares of land had been burned.</p>

          <p><b>5. Typhoon in Idalia (26-31 August 2023)</b></p>

          <p>This year saw 20 hurricanes in the Atlantic basin, of which seven developed into hurricanes and three of which intensified into major hurricanes. The most destructive hurricane was Hurricane Idalia, a Category 3 hurricane that hit Florida's Gulf Coast, causing more than 80% of the season's damage. It was the strongest storm to hit the Big Bend region, the junction of the panhandle and the peninsula, in more than 125 years. This storm caused flooding in several areas and more than 150,000 customers in the southeast experienced power outages.</p>
